Hey guys, I am trying to build a DIY CNC that is controlled with a RAMPS board mounted on an Arduino 2560. I have access to a variety of the mechanical parts (motors,bearings, basically everything required to build a CNC). I'd like to use Mach3 since I can procure a license for it easily. Is this possible with a RAMPS + arduino combination? What is the general process in building something like this - I understand that I need a g-code exporter, but my question is, how to I set up the arduino GRBL and Arduino based 3D CNC Control This hardware solution allows you in a very simple way, to mill your CNC G-Code files in 3D with your CNC mi.  US Ship 5 Axis MACH3 CNC Breakout Board Interface for Stepper Motor Driver. Are there any substantial differences between these two options? I am looking for some insight as to what to choose. I am leaning towards Arduino w/CNC shield. (I am in the process of building a desktop cnc using scanner/printer parts. I work in IT and have a lot of ewaste with good mechanicals to harvest) edit: I am also considering using LinuxCNC but can accommodate pretty much any setup. hello Mr innovative i have a problem but i do not know where it is. software or drivers drv8825 with engines nema 17 1.7am 1/8 ° practically the software works but the motors do not move, if i do test with a example directly code grbl from arduino the engines work you could give me a good advice please are two days shaking my head I'm using grbl / inkscape / Universal Gcode Sender Drv8825. 21 апр 2016  Вставляем драйвер ШД DRV8825 в ось Х, "крутилкой"  Сейчас как раз задумался о сборке крупного 3Д фрезера под управлением ардуино.  1. ArtCam позволяет делать GCODE из STL файлов и чертежей. I saw this project (https://sites.google.com/site/0miker0/home) a while ago, and since I have some old CD/DVD drives laying around, I'd like to have a go at building it. However, I'm reluctant to order a controller since I live in Podunk, EU and shipping's going to cost a pretty penny. Is this ( all I need? Since. Скачал программу Inkscape рисую круг в ней, делаю генерацию G-code, режу! И опять на 25 % меньше того что мне надо. Размеры кругов были разные но процент уменьшения все время 25%.

GRBL controller application with G-Code visualizer written in Qt. - Denvi/Candle. So yesterday everything was fine. I uploaded a new program to the board and ran it. Today I connected the board again with USB to win10 laptop to change something. -NO usb connecting sound -port is greyed out under ports in device manager -ports tab is greyed out in arduino software -the board DOES GET power from the laptop and the code on it does still run -windows did an update this morning So either - board is bad? ( but it is still working?) - cable is bad? (but it gives power?). Hello everyone, after i have posted many problems on this subreddit, including burning drivers. I have bought all components (arduino, cnc shield and a4988 driver) i have installed everything and uploaded following code: \#include const int stepsPerRevolution = 200; // change this to fit the number of steps per revolution // for your motor // initialize the stepper library on pins 8 through 11: Stepper myStepper(stepsPerRevolution Hi, I have a problem with my nema 17 and tb6600 driver connected to arduino nano. I used this code with A4988 without problems and it works on Tb6600 too, its just that the motor starts to overheat very quickly and is releasing high pitched sounds. It was running smoother on A4988 too, but I needed more torque so I went with driver upgrade. Also I dont remember that much motor noise from A4988. Motor is 1.7A Nema 17, and it overheats quickly even on lowest current setting on TB6600 (0,5A). Hi and good morning everyone. I want to make an automated wire/filament cutter for recycling purposes. I'm an electrical engineer and have never really interacted much with controlling steppers with an Arduino. Here is what I have: A stepper motor that drives a Dremel. A stepper with a filament feeder mechanism. 2 stepper drivers Arduino uno I want to write code that will allow me to feed 11.5mm sections of either filament or wire and have the Dremel go back and forth cutting such sections. Lets me start off with this is my first "not a tutorial" project in Arduino (this is just for me) but I am trying to implement some commands to ping a host using the #include I don't get any error in the code (right now it's just the demo code from the website ) but when I go to compile I get: "Error compiling for the board adafruit feather huzzah esp8266" I'm pretty sure its something obvious but I just have a lot of troubleshooting experience 4 months into my job out of college as a Software QA engineer, and though I like the products that we do testing on, it seems to have become more mundane to me, especially for the past couple of weeks; I haven't written any code in a while, and been mainly doing tests maintenance, bug tracking, opening Jiras, and trying to solve the issues assigned to me, but it hasn't been like I had to write something from scratch but more of adding/removing a few lines of code to make it work as expected. 
Hello, this is a followup to my post a while ago on DIY about connecting PV panels to a water heater element. In the original post, I glossed over the MPPT arduino contraption that has been instrumental in maximum solar output for two years. https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/7arbcp/i\_installed\_pv\_panels\_to\_heat\_my\_hot\_water/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/7arbcp/i_installed_pv_panels_to_heat_my_hot_water/) To help lay out what I have please allow me to explain Hi all, can any one please tell about how the arduino code for I2C can be written for this particular encoder used in the following motor. ( how to use this in arduino library?? how to use this in arduino for speed and direction control?? cant we use this rotary encoder code as given in arduino: the code for I2C for above motor. The basics of this system -- it uses a Pi with an inexpensive () Software Defined Radio( r/RTLSDR ) to create a network of amateur satellite radio groundstations, and a part of this system is an automatic motorized (DC motor or stepper) Azimuth/Elevation controller using an Arduino for the brain. It's all opensource. the rotator is on its third revision, and the engineering is impressive. They provide all the files and specs necessary to 3d print and build your own. https://www.youtube.com/. Hello, My school's robotics team has just finished building an arduino rc car controlled via a DualShock 2. We are using an L298 motor driver for the two motors and powering it with an 11.1 volt battery. Today was the inaugural run, and we ran into two problems: First of all, each wheel turns at different speeds leading it to run in a perpetual circle unless individually correcting for each wheel's speed. This shouldn't be a problem, because we've configured each joystick to control Hi all. I am new to arduino. can any one please tell about how the arduino code for I2C can be written for this particular encoder used in the following motor. the code for I2C for above motor is I2C\_Start(0x10 + 0); // send the slave address of the RMCS-220x and write bit 0 I2C\_Write(1); // send the command variable for speed I2C\_Write(255); // send LSB of 255 I2C\_Write(0); Line following robot is an autonomous robot that can follow a path.

This DIY project will generate a 3D display pattern using Arduino Hello folks, I have been lurking in here for quite some time, because I have been wanting to upgrade to mechanical keyboard for quite awhile now, but I am making this post for another reason. I would like start a little project and I have some questions that the Wiki could not answer me, about some things and their scale. Furthermore, I would like to emphasise that I am not writing this, because I want people to just tell me what to do on a silver plate , but to help me find where I connected the motorshield (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-shield-v2-for-arduino/overview)(v2) to arduino uno using stackable headers. Plugged the arduino into pc using USB. Connected a dc motor that came with the kit into M1 and connected a 9v battery to power in the shield. Tried running the DCMotorTest example (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-shield-v2-for-arduino/using-dc-motors)from motor shield v2 library and the serial output prints "ticktocktech" but the motor.
